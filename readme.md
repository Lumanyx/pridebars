Fancy progress bars for JetBrains IDEs, themed around various pride flags.

# Included flags

- Pride
- Transgender
- Lesbian
- Gay
- Aromantic
- Aromantic Asexual
- Omnisexual
- Pansexual
- Bisexual
- Polysexual
- Non-binary
- Asexual

More flags may be added in the future. I only focused on flags that can easily be represented with a gradient for now.
