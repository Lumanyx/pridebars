# PrideBars

Fancy progress bars for JetBrains IDEs, themed around various pride flags.

# Configuration

Open your IDE settings and navigate to `Appearance & Behavior > PrideBars`. Pick your desired flag from the dropdown menu and click "Apply".
Note: After installing the plugin, you may need to restart your IDE for the settings to take effect.
